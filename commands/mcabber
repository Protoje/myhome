# Multiline
/msay begin|verbatim|send|send_to|toggle|toggle_verbatim|abort

Send a multi-line message. To write a single message with several lines, the multi-line mode should be used. In multi-line mode, each line (except command lines) typed in the input line will be added to the multi-line message. Once the message is finished, it can be sent to the current selected buddy with the "/msay send" command (or Ctrl-d). The begin subcommand enables multi-line mode. Note that it allows a message subject to be specified. The verbatim multi-line mode disables commands, so that it is possible to enter lines starting with a slash. Only the "/msay" command (with send or abort parameters) can be used to exit verbatim mode. The toggle and toggle_verbatim subcommands can be bound to a key to use the multi-line mode quickly (for example, "bind M109 = msay toggle" to switch using the Meta-m combination).
begin [subject]	enter multi-line mode 
verbatim	enter verbatim multi-line mode 
send	send the current multi-line message to the currently selected buddy 
send_to jid	send the current multi-line message to "jid" 
toggle	switch to/from multi-line mode (begin/send)
